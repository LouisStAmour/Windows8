These buttons (“charms”) provide a means for Windows 8 apps to expose commonly used features in a manner that is consistent across apps. For example, if you want to perform a search in an app, you select the Search charm and type a search term into the search pane. The UI – and the actions required to invoke that UI – are the same in every app.",
